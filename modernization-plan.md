# Lunch Application Modernization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to convert the legacy client/server VB6 lunch application in the `VisualBasic6/` folder to a modern TypeScript-based architecture. The plan focuses on maintaining the core functionality and visual appearance while modernizing the technology stack.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- [ ] Create a new React application using TypeScript
- [ ] Implement the main UI components:
  - [ ] Main window with black background and white text
  - [ ] LED indicator (red/green) for confirmation status
  - [ ] Restaurant choice display with Comic Sans MS font
  - [ ] Voting buttons (Yes/No)
  - [ ] New Random button
  - [ ] Menu bar with Administer options
- [ ] Create additional UI components:
  - [ ] User Info panel
  - [ ] Group Info panel
  - [ ] Restaurants panel
  - [ ] Login dialog
  - [ ] Chat windows (User and Group)
- [ ] Implement real-time updates using WebSocket
- [ ] Add responsive design for modern screen resolutions

### 2. Backend (Node.js + TypeScript)
- [ ] Set up Express.js server with TypeScript
- [ ] Create RESTful API endpoints:
  - [ ] User management
  - [ ] Group management
  - [ ] Restaurant management
  - [ ] Voting system
  - [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server for real-time notifications
- [ ] Create database schema (PostgreSQL recommended)
- [ ] Implement data migration from Access database

### 3. Database Migration
- [ ] Create new database schema:
  - [ ] Users table
  - [ ] Groups table
  - [ ] Restaurants table
- [ ] Develop migration script from Access to new database
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization

### 4. Authentication & Security
- [ ] Implement modern authentication system
- [ ] Add user session management
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement secure WebSocket connections

### 5. Configuration Management
- [ ] Create configuration system for:
  - [ ] Server settings
  - [ ] Database connection
  - [ ] Notification times
  - [ ] Voting parameters
- [ ] Implement environment-based configuration

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Write unit tests for:
  - [ ] Frontend components
  - [ ] Backend services
  - [ ] Database operations
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end testing

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create Docker containers for:
  - [ ] Frontend application
  - [ ] Backend server
  - [ ] Database
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Real-time: WebSocket
- Authentication: JWT
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
- Containerization: Docker
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Migration Strategy
1. Set up new development environment
2. Create new database schema
3. Implement backend services
4. Develop frontend components
5. Migrate existing data
6. Test thoroughly
7. Deploy to production
8. Phase out old system

## Notes
- Maintain the original black background with white text theme
- Keep the Comic Sans MS font for restaurant choices
- Preserve the LED indicator functionality
- Maintain the same voting and random selection logic
- Keep the group-based restaurant selection system
- Preserve the chat functionality
- Maintain the same notification system timing

## Future Considerations
- Mobile app version
- Browser notifications
- Email notifications
- Restaurant ratings and reviews
- Integration with restaurant APIs
- Advanced group management features
